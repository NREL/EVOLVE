#### :fire: Second way is to launch both services independently.

1. Clone the code (you can use command `git clone https://github.nrel.gov/kduwadi/BYPL-NREL-Effort.git`)
2. Create a virtual environment with preferably python 3.8 version
3. Install dependencies using command `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Install Node.js (https://nodejs.org/en/) 
5. Open up a command prompt from inside `react-app` folder and run command `npm install` 


#### Spin off the Python Server

It makes the RESTful API available to front end React App. 
Execute the command `python src\server\server.py`. 

#### Spin off the react front-end

From the react app directory, open up a command prompt and execute `npm start`

NOTE: Images can also be direclty downloaded from Docker Hub
