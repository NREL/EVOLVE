:wave: Welcome to EVOLVE repository!

Analysing time series data is an integral part of distribution engineers daily task. With EVOLVE, you can achieve more with time series load profile data you have. You can look at 
impact of technologies such as solar, energy storage and electric vehicle on net load profile of your system. Apart from the visualization it also gives you key metrics around each technologies.
